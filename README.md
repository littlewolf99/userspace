# Userspace - a simple social app demo

A simple web app that demonstrates usage of `Relay` and `GraphQL`. Supported by back end that uses `PostgreSQL` to store main data and `Neo4j` for graph-like relations between models.

## Used technologies

- `React`: for front end UI
- `React Router v6`: Latest version of react-router that supports render-as-you-fetch pattern
- `Relay`: front end GraphQL library
- `antd`: UI framework
- `graphql-yoga`: GraphQL server framework
- `typeorm`: ORM to access data in Postgres database
- `neo4j-driver`: Official Node.js driver of Neo4j graph database
- `TypeScript` for both back and front ends: static typing makes your life easier in the long run
